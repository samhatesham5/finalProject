      <h2>Last week, I spent a total of 6 hours and 15 minutes on Instagram.</h2>
      <p> (Don't even get me started on the number of hours I spend on YouTube.)</p>
      <br>
      <p>According to an article from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2021/06/24/americans-spent-more-than-1300-hours-on-social-media/?sh=201ea54e2547">Forbes Magazine,</a> in 2020, "driven in no small part by the pandemic, Americans spent more than an average 1,300 hours on social media." To be fair, high social media usage could be an American thing.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So let's take in consideration the rest of the globe. An article from <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/time-spent-on-social-media/#gref">techjury</a> shares that the average internet user spent 2 hours and 24 minutes per day on social media in 2020. That's over 800 hours a year on the top six social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, and Twitter).</p>

        <h2>So why is this important?</h2>
        <br>
        <p class= "textTwo">Every time you log onto social media, there's very little control over what you see. One minute there's an image of a cute down, the next there's a gory image. While some social media platforms work to provide trigger warnings and things of that nature to certain images, it's hard to ignore the intention of social media.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="textTwo"> Social media apps need you to use them for as long as possible. But, to do that, social media apps have to be designed to manipulate our emotions, sometimes in ways that don't benefit the user. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="textTwo">So, why should we spend so much time on apps that can make us feel great one minute but awful the next? Why can't we interact with social media in a way that is beneficial?</p>
