        <h2>Why Do People Share On Social Media</h2>
        <p>Nature of social media is about communication. <a class="influencLink" href="https://contentworks.medium.com/the-psychology-of-social-sharing-82be5fe08436">Some</a> say it's similar to Maslow's Hierachy, which is broken down by the image on the left.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Other researchers say it's because social media sharing "can link to positive social media feedback and self esteem."</p>
        <br>
        <p><a class="influencLink" href="https://online.king.edu/news/psychology-of-social-media/">More</a> researchers are noticing that children and adolescenets are having their identities shaped by engaging with social media. </p>

        <h2>How Do Social Media Platforms Work</h2>
        <p>Social media platforms need to maximize user engagement because platforms make profits off of advertisements. So  algorithms are created to maximize engagement by figuring out what is relevant and what you like, then ranking those at the top of user's feed. </p>
        <br>
        <p>To some, this may not sound particularly terrible. Rather than be recommended products that users don't care about, advertisers now can almost directly target you. However, algorithms can be pretty destructive when looking at the quality of content that's being spread and how that affects us.</p>

    <div class="reasonThree">
      <h2>How Social Media Influences Us</h2>
      <p>In an experiment ran by those at <a class="influencLink" href="https://bigthink.com/the-present/social-media-algorithms-manipulate-you/">bigthink</a>, they found that people are more likely to like or share low credibility sources than flag it. And as we know, the more likes or reactions a source gets, the more likely it is to pop up into your feed.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So let's take Twitter for example, whose algorithm can be the main instigator in a lot of arguments on the platform. Say someone posts something another person disagrees with. All it takes is for a few people to react to the post and the hashtag related to the post could be on Twitter's trending tab. </p>
      <br>
      <p>More people find out about it, more arguments ensue. But Twitter doesn't mind so long as you're still using their platform. </p>

      <h2>Other Ways Social Media Influences Us</h2>
      <p>Users are just using social media as a platform for communication but for information as well. Some users find their favorite movies or artists through social media. </p>
      <br>
      <p>While this is a benefit of social media, this begs so many questions about how much of our thoughts or opinions are our own if we're always being influenced to.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answerCard">
      <p>If we're only seeing what our algorithms feed us, how much control do these platforms have over us?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="influenceCall">
    <div class="smallCard">
      <h2>that was a lot so here's a brief recap</h2>
      <p>We share only social media as a way to communicate with other people. Using social media actually satisfies a lot of our needs. However, social media algorithms are created to maximize user engagement to ensure that you see advertisements so the platform can make a profit.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This may not sound terrible to some but when you think about the quality of information being shared, sometimes it can lead into cycles in which negative feedback from posts are promoted to encourage user engagment. And since so many people are using the Internet to formulate their opinions and make decisions, then how much of our beliefs belong to us if we're always being influenced to.</p>
