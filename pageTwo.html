        <p> I know, it's very cheesy. Before you log on or open the app, think about how you're feeling and how you want to feel throughout the day.

      </div>
      <div class="activeOne">
        <h2 class="tipHeaders">O1 - Check information before posting</h2>

        <h2 class="tipHeaders">02 - Be clear about your intentions when you log on</h2>
        <p>When conversations surrounding stressful situations arise in the news and online, it's always okay to take a step back from using social media. But if you find youself wanting to use these platforms during the moments, sometimes it's helpful to be clear about your purpose. Think about what you want to get from using a certain social media platform and once you've had fulfilled that purpose, log off. If logging off is a struggle, set a timer as well as a purpose prior to logging on. It can also be helpful to check in with youself afterwards before moving on.</p>

      <h2 class="tipHeaders">03 - Spread information and awareness but beware of spreading graphic content</h2>
      <p>Though there's a lot of controversy about whether spreading graphic content can count as activism, it's best steer away from sharing anything triggering (especially without some sort of trigger warning) to protect both your mental health and that of your followers.</p>

      <h2>Tips for Beauty Fans</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="beautyOne">
      <h2 class="tipHeaders">O1 - Train the algorithm</h2>
      <p>For Instagram users, since your feed is curated based on what kinds of posts you're engaging with, by engaging with posts you want to see more of, you can train the algorithm to give you a more positive feed. You can start by liking posts that are more positive for you and selected "not interested" those that are not.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="beautyTwo">
      <h2 class="tipHeaders">02 - When you start to compare yourself, take a step back</h2>
      <p>You can do this literally or metaphorically. There is so much effort that goes into making social media posts.  Very rarely do people post candid pictures of themselves, especially not as a beauty influencers. Influencers and non-influencers alike show what they want you to see, which is almost always the good stuff. </p>
      <br>
      <p>	Not comparing yourself is easier said than done but sometimes putting the post into perspective can be helpful.</p>

        <h2>Tips for Those With Online Friends</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="gamesOne">
        <h2 class="tipHeaders">O1 - Turn off notifications </h2>
        <p>This tip is for people that are always checking if someone is texting them. For some people this is a radical way of solving this issue, but it works! You don't have to turn off notifications for every group chat or person, only the few that are causing anxiety or stress. Ironically, this is an anxiety inducing habit to build (trust me I know). You'll feel more confident knowing that your emotions aren't so heavily connected to people texting you</p>

      <div class="gamesTwo">
        <h2 class="tipHeaders">02 - Unfollow people you don't like</h2>
        <p>Sometimes it's fun to hate watch other people's stories or posts, but it is one of the biggest wastes of time and energy. Unfollow them. If you really don't care for them, you shouldn't regret it.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="gamesThree">
      <h2 class="tipHeaders">03 - Get your friends involved</h2>
